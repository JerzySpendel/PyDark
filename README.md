PyDark
======

PyDark is a 2D and Online Multiplayer video game engine written on-top of Python and PyGame. 

**Prerequisites:** Python 2.7+, PyGame, Twisted

*PyDark* is composed of six modules:
- Engine: The core 2D engine in charge of sprites, physics, terrain, world and Game objects.
- Vector2D: Our 2D mathematical equations are stored here.
- UI: The core user-interface objects: TextInput, Button, Label, and others are stored here.
- Network: The core twisted-based networking library for creating online multiplayer games.
- Storage: The core file-storage engine that allows you to create custom file formats for maps, tiles, images and any other type of resource. 
- Security: The core security module that allows you to prevent hackers from cheating on your game. Although our Networking library is 100% server-sided, you can use functionality from this module to detect Cheat Engine, DLL injections and other sorts of hacking techniquies.

Overview
======
*PyDark* was designed from the ground up to allow upcoming game developers to quickly and efficiently create 2D games for Windows, Linux and even video game Consoles(although you must apply through the Console manufacturer's webpage).
